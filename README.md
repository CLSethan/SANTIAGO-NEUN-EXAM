NEUN FARBEN GAME DEVELOPER EXAM, Turn Based Strategy Game


Though it is merely a stretch goal, I am really glad that i took the time to learn A star pathfinding to implement with my game alongside grid movement. This is my first time creating a turn based 3d game, so it was really enjoyable to learn as it has sparked my eagerness as a developer to learn different ways of creating features.

I am also really proud of the action system that I put in, as it can really be expanded upon as much as possible
